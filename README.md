# EcoSystem Bundle: Organic Pizza Co. Demo

This is a slighly more fully featured demo than the basic [Dog Shelter bundle](https://github.com/ecosystemsoftware/eco_bundle_dogshelter).  The website uses HTML partial insertion with AJAX to implement dynamic cart functionality, demonstrating the use of EcoSystem's HTML api to serve both full pages and HTML partials.  The admin panel features more complex layouts, including embedded lists used to add and remove toppings from pizzas.

## Installation

Assuming you already have EcoSystem installed and a project folder created, cd into the 'bundles' folder of your project folder, clone this repository and run `ecosystem install`:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ecosystemsoftware/eco_bundle_organicpizza.git
$ cd ..
$ ecosystem install eco_bundle_organicpizza
```
